  "scenario": "In the early 2030s, after the Great Decentralization Movement, the internet transformed into the \"Flourish Network\"\u2014a constellation of community-owned mesh networks powered by renewable energy. Data centers, once massive energy sinks, have been replaced by distributed microcenters housed in community gardens, rooftop solar arrays, and wind-powered co-ops. The new internet operates on a \"Prosocial Protocol\" that allocates bandwidth based on community benefit rather than profit potential. Urban farming collectives share realtime soil and climate data through tactile interfaces woven from recycled e-waste and biodegradable polymers. Instead of algorithms optimizing for engagement, the Attention Cooperative stewards digital spaces that enhance genuine human connection. Users navigate the network through immersive \"groves\"\u2014collaborative spaces where information grows like living gardens, tended by community librarians and knowledge gardeners. Hyperlocal exchange platforms have replaced global e-commerce, with physical location and resource sharing embedded in the digital architecture. The barriers between online and offline have dissolved as augmented reality overlays show the ecological impact of physical actions and suggest community-sourced alternatives\u2014an internet devoted not to extraction but to regeneration."
