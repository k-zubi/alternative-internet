  "scenario": "In 2077, after the Corporate Wars, six megacorporations divided the remnants of the global network. This fractured internet, known as \"NeoNet,\" is a digital battleground where corporate enclaves control verified citizens through neural interfaces, while the outcasts\u2014digital nomads and rogue AI collectives\u2014roam the unpatrolled dataflows of the Deep Grid. Information is the most valuable currency, traded in black market data-havens and protected by militarized ICE protocols that can trigger seizures or brain death in unauthorized users. Advertisements materialize unbidden in users' peripheral vision, personalized by invasive biometric monitoring. Those wealthy enough maintain digital avatars that persist autonomously in VR social clubs even while they sleep. Meanwhile, resistance networks mask communications as innocuous entertainment streams, sending coded messages through popular neural-dance recordings and augmented reality games. Corporations offer citizens the illusion of freedom while monitoring every digital footprint, using predictive algorithms to eliminate dissenters before they act\u2014an internet built not for connection, but for control."
